A recent read reminded me of the delicate balance - one I find myself continuously navigating - between strengthening core statistics & embracing the latest advancements (like tools that automate parameter selection & modeling). **𝗜𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗻, 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆'𝗿𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝘂𝗽𝗼𝗻.**

If you've wondered how to see-saw the two sides without falling off, here are some ways that have worked for me.

⚖️ I irregularly return to books & papers that have shaped my knowledge. The [QASS Little Green books](https://guides.lib.ua.edu/c.php?g=736206&p=10025333) are a well-thumbed resource for statistical methods.

⚖️ I like explaining concepts to a live or imaginary audience. After all, teaching is the fastest way to learn. Look up the learning pyramid, developed by the NTL Institute of Applied Behavioral Science. Thanks Kim Muije for sharing this!

⚖️ Periodical data talks, blog discussions, with analyst friends from different industries expose me to perspectives that I wouldn't otherwise encounter. 

⚖️ My workplace has 2 crafting days, each month, dedicated to learning & exploring with pet projects.

⚖️ I love puzzles & solving these in a new tool is a fun way to stay tool-agnostic. I enjoy [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
