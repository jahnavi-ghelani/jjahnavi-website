As a leading data scientist, while mentoring analysts and non-analysts, I often saw bright minds hesitate to ask questions on concepts they felt they “should” know - what they felt might be “stupid questions”. Especially, in fields like data science, where technical complexity, rapid evolution and high competition make people hesitant to reveal knowledge gaps. 

However, as anybody with teaching experience will tell you, there is no such thing as a stupid question (provided people are being sincere) and often such brave questions help others in the room. People with teaching experience will also tell you that employing bravery in asking questions is a rare but contagious trait. Hear someone ask an “obvious” question, and it becomes slightly easier for others to follow. And, lastly, people with teaching experience will add that you cannot rely on this bravery alone to weed out hesitation from your entire audience.

And so, **how does one ensure psychological safety in ambitious, high-performing groups where technical complexity, rapid evolution and competition make people hesitant to reveal knowledge gaps?** This question prompted my exploration into ways to create psychological safety in ambitious, high-performing groups such as mine. Here's what I've learnt so far. 

### Good leadership involves modeling vulnerability
The most powerful signal comes from leaders openly acknowledging their own knowledge gaps. When I said "I don't understand how this algorithm works—can someone walk me through it?" or "I haven't worked with this tool before," I was liberating others from the fear of consequences to acknowledge their own knowledge gaps. This has been especially effective in fields like data science because it is genuinely too vast for any one person/group to know everything. My advice is to do this authentically, not performatively - ask about things you don't know, not things you secretly do know.

### Normalize learning publicly
Create explicit moments where learning happens out loud. This might look like:

* Learning sessions where someone presents a concept they're currently learning (not mastering)
* Rotating explain-like-I'm-5 presentations where people practice making complex topics accessible
* A team channel for ‘things I learned this week’ that celebrates discovery rather than prior knowledge
* Code reviews framed as collaborative learning rather than gatekeeping

### Reframe questions as contributions
Help your team see that asking questions actually adds value to the group. Someone asking "why did we choose this approach?" might surface an assumption that needs re-examination. Someone asking "what does this metric actually measure?" might reveal ambiguity that would have caused problems downstream. You can actively thank people for questions that made you think differently or caught something important.

### Create low-stakes inquiry spaces
Separate high-pressure decision-making from exploratory discussions. This might mean:

* ‘Office hours’ where any question is welcome without meeting pressure
* Pair-programming or pair-analysis time where the explicit goal is mutual learning
* Pre-mortems where the team actively tries to find flaws and gaps in their own thinking
* ‘Stupid questions’ slack threads (rebranding the negative framing can work since owning it removes its power.)

### Address competence signaling directly

In ambitious groups, people often compete to appear most knowledgeable. You might need to explicitly discuss how this dynamic undermines the team. Frame it as: "We're trying to solve hard problems, which means we need everyone's actual understanding, not everyone's performance of understanding." Some teams even establish a norm where if someone uses jargon without defining it, anyone can call a ‘jargon flag’ without judgment.

### Distinguish between different types of knowledge gaps
Help people recognize that there are legitimate reasons for knowledge gaps:

* The field changed (previous approaches are now outdated)
* It's specialized (knowing deep learning doesn't mean knowing time series)
* Context differs (your previous company used different tools)
* It's genuinely new (emerging techniques)

When someone asks a question, occasionally name which category it falls into: "That's a great question - this is a newer approach that wasn't common a year ago."

### Build question-asking skills
Some people struggle with not only whether to ask questions but also *how* to ask these. Coach on:

* Framing questions as collaborative problem-solving ("I'm trying to understand X so I can do Y")
* Being specific about what they do/don't understand ("I follow the first two steps but lose the thread at...")
* Asking questions that advance the discussion ("If we went with approach A instead, would that address...?")

### Create accountability for psychological safety
Make it a team responsibility, not only yours. When someone responds dismissively to a question, address it directly (privately if necessary). When someone says "you should already know this," that's a team culture violation worth discussing. Conversely, recognize people who are particularly good at making space for questions.

### Use retrospectives strategically
Periodically ask: "What questions didn't we ask in this project that we should have?" This helps people see that unasked questions have consequences, and it identifies patterns in what people feel they can't ask about.

The underlying principle is that psychological safety in ambitious groups doesn't come from lowering standards, it comes from redirecting competitive energy toward collective problem-solving rather than individual status protection. When the team identity becomes ‘we figure things out together’ rather than ‘we each prove our worth’, questions transform from vulnerabilities into tools.
